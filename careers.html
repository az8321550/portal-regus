                    <p>
                        For more than few years, PIT has been experiencing positive growth on a global scale. Through it all, it's our people — customers, business partners and team members — who keep us moving forward through the rapidly changing market.
                        We have built a solid, worldwide PIT community. We focus more on the people, care about the daily lives of our team members, whose contributions make our whole group to reach the goal.
                        Our philosophy toward people is to "build enduring relationships with both external and internal team members." The focus in PIT for our team members is mainly on creating an environment where every individual can be their best and do their best work in service of our customers.

Our shared values enable us to combine our personal strengths with those of others to make PIT stronger, better, more innovative and more successful.
We could write a novel about our values. We’re a company that spans many countries and cultures, and values are hugely important to us. But when you boil it down, there are just four simple things that guide us. And it doesn’t matter who or where we are within PIT, there are values we share.</span>

It’s about speaking openly and being prepared to have the tough conversations. It’s about treating others as we expect them to treat us. And it’s about having the courage to speak up and challenge when things just don’t seem right.</span>
